# CSS2XML

Script to serialize CSS to XML

Uses gnosis for the XML encoding.

Only retrieves rules and properties.

## TODO

- get rid of gnosis (very old and strange)
- better / nicer XML serialization
- get more things from the CSS
  - list of selectors
  - parsed selectors into element|class|id etc.
  - other elements (imports, comments, priorities, etc.)
